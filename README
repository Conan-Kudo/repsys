repsys is the tool used to manage RPM packages in both subversion, git-svn
& git repositories on Mandrake Linux derived GNU/Linux distributions.
It is used to create, tag releases, generate .src.rpm, generate changelog,
and request new package releases for build. It mostly acts as a interface
to svn(1) commands and small task scripts run that on the build system side
over ssh(1).

For more information, see repsys(8)

The discussion on the development of repsys currently takes place at
